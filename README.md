# Spark Profiling Plugin 

### Intro
This plugin allows profiling a spark application. It collects profiling data both from the driver and the executors, to get a detailed view of the application's cpu usage, memory allocations, lock contention, etc.
The implementation uses 2 components:
1. [Pyroscope Java agent](https://grafana.com/docs/pyroscope/next/configure-client/language-sdks/java/) - to collect the profiling samples from the java processes and report them to a Pyroscope server.
2. [Apache Spark plugin](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/java/index.html?org/apache/spark/api/plugin/SparkPlugin.html) - custom plugin implementation for starting the agent on every node, while attaching a context to the profiling data in runtime. 
It's using the plugin methods onTaskStart, onTaskSucceeded & onTaskFailed to mark the execution flow with the relevant context labels for the profiler: executor, stage and partition.

The result allows investigating the profiling data in multiple ways - either as a whole, using an aggregated view of the entire app, or as some zoom-in view by breaking it down by executor, stage or partition.

### Using it
1. Download the released plugin jar. 
2. Submit your spark job including the plugin configurations. e.g:
   ``` 
   ./spark-submit \
   ... your arguments ... \
   --jars <YOUR_PATH_TO_THE_PLUGIN_JAR_LOCATION>/spark_profiling_plugin-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
   --conf spark.plugins='com.github.tomsisso.spark.plugins.profiling.SparkProfilingPlugin' \
   --conf spark.plugins.profiling.plugin.server.address='http://<YOUR_PYROSCOPE_SERVER>:4040' \
   --conf spark.plugins.profiling.plugin.upload.interval.seconds=10 \
   /<YOUR_APP>.jar
   ```
